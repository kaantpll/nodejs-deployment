### Nodejs Deployment And Scaling

The project describes the deployment stages of a Node.js application from scratch to production. It covers CI/CD processes, and the application can be scaled using Kubernetes. Also I tested many functions (There are not a lot functions ðŸ˜Š).
#### NOTE: I use configmap on Kubernetes for .env property. If you want to use kubernetes you have to create configmap and define to deployment.yaml. 
--------
Tech I Use : 
  - Nodejs (Express)
  - MongoDB
  - Jest (Testing)
  - Docker
  - Kubernetes (Minikube for locally)
  - CI/CD (Github Actions)

Prerequisites :
 - Nodejs
 - Kubernetes Cluster ( I used minikube on local. You can use Google Cloud or AWS )
